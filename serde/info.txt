Serializing and Deserializing Objects
- useful for persistence and/or transmission.
 sometimes we have objects (data)
- want to "save" them somewhere so we can retrieve ("load") them later.
- even after program that generated the data has terminated.
- transmit them to someone or something else outside our app.

Generically applies to any object
- create a persistent representation of the object -> Serializing.
- reconstruct the object from the serialized data -> Deserializing.

Python Specific - built-in mechanism to serialize and Deserialize many objects using binary representation.

Pickling - 
- A way to represnt an object in a persistent way -> disk, transmission.
create an object's representation -> serializing
                                                    -> marshalling
create object from representation -> deserializing

import pickle

dump -> pickle to file
load -> unpickle from file

dumps -> returns a string pickled representation -> store in a variable.
loads -> unpickle from supplied argument.
